# Introduction
A course diary is to be maintained by each faculty of the department for each course
handled by him/her. It mainly includes Schedule of Work, Syllabus, Course plan,
Attendance, Subject coverage.This project provides more efficient methods to handle the
academic activities of a faculty during a course.
Course diary is to be prepared in a manner to aid the faculty to organize their lectures, how
much topic to be presented on each class even before the commencements of the class. At
each class, the faculty records attendance in the course diary and at the end of the
semester, faculty uses these records in academic audits. The existing system contains few
problems such as, since the data entry is a manual process, it is prone to errors. The entire
process is very time consuming as there is no automation at any step of the process and
manpower needs to be employed to record attendance details.
In our new and improved Course Diary, we store these data digitally. Course Plan is
prepared automatically by splitting the syllabus in accordance to the number of working
hours in a semester. Attendance can be recorded by using Optical Character Recognition
(OCR) technique. The attendance sheet is scanned through an optical scanner and an
image for the corresponding sheet is maintained. The image is then fed into the OCR
system, which is programmed beforehand for a predefined format of attendance sheet. We
can calculate the present percentage of the student according to his/her roll number.
